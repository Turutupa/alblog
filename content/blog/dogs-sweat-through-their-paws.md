Have you ever noticed your dog's paws smelling like corn chips? Turns out, this isn't because they've broken into your pantry. Although dogs cool themselves down by panting – which circulates air through their bodies – they actually sweat through their paw pads. When sweat and bacteria build up on their feet, it gives off that unique scent. Cleaning your dog's paws is especially necessary in the winter if they're trotting through salt; dog paws are very sensitive to the elements. However, a muddy summer is also a reason to clean their feet. Dirty paws can hide cuts or abrasions on the paw pads, making it harder to tell when your pup needs a trip to the vet. For minor cleanups, a moist towelette (like a baby wipe) should do the trick. Just make sure to check the product's ingredients; some compounds that are safe for humans (like alcohol) can be harmful to your furry friend. If a wipe isn't enough, you may need to clean paws in the tub with pet-safe soap and water. Dry gently with a towel when you're done.

### Another reason I love dogs

Have you read [the research that dogs obey women more than men](https://www.southernliving.com/news/study-shows-dogs-obey-women-more)? According to the article, women are more sensitive to emotional stimulants, making them more likely to understand their pups. Barking is one of the keys to understanding what's going on with your dog – or, what they want. [Wag!](https://wagwalking.com/behavior/why-dogs-bark "(opens new window)") shared a few indicators of what different tones or pitches of bark could signify: "A single whiny yap might signify your pup is hungry and wants some dinner. A constant highly pitched bark could mean he's excited at the new toy you've just brought home or he might be trying to let you know he is afraid of it. A throaty growl can be either playful or display aggression. A constant, agitated bark could mean there is someone lurking by the front door." Your pet is likely trying to tell you something when he or she speaks to you; don't pass off all barks as just wanting attention. It could be as simple as your pup missing you when you went to work, or exploring a new place that makes him or her nervous. Pay attention when your dog is barking – you may just get to know your furry friend a little better.
